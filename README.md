### Syntax

**Excessive requests will be terminated with an error 429 (Too Many Requests)! And `X-RateLimit-RetryAfter` header will be returned.**

For single resource:

```
ratelimit methods path rate burst unit
```

- `methods` are the request methods it will match (comma separately)

- `path` is the file or directory to apply `rate limit`

- `rate` is the limited request in every time unit (r/s, r/m, r/h, r/d, r/w) (e.g. 1)

- `burst` is the maximum burst size client can exceed; burst >= rate (e.g. 2)

- `unit` is the time interval (currently support: `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`)

For multiple resources:

```
ratelimit methods rate burst unit {
    whitelist CIDR,CIDR
    limit_by_header xxx
    status xxx,xxx
    resources
}
```

- `whitelist` is the keyword for whitelist your trusted ips (comma separately). [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) is the IP range you don't want to perform `rate limit`. `whitelist` is a general rule, it won't target for specific resource.
- `limit_by_header` is the keyword for matching the [request header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields). Like `whitelist`, it's also a general rule.
**Note:** normally you shouldn't apply this rule unless the default `limit by ip` is not what you want and you want to `limit by request header`(e.g. `Authorization`).
- `status` is the keyword for matching the [response status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) (comma separately).
If this rule is triggered, all subsequent requests from that client will be blocked regardless of which status code is returned or which resource is requested.
**Note:** this won't block resources not defined in `ratelimit`'s config.
- `resources` is a list of files/directories to apply `rate limit`, one per line

**Note:** If you don't want to apply `rate limit` on some special resources, add `^` in front of the path.


### Examples

Limit clients to 2 requests per second (bursts of 3) to any methods and any resources under /r:

```
ratelimit * /r 2 3 second
```

Don't perform `rate limit` if requests come from **1.2.3.4** or **192.168.1.0/30(192.168.1.0 ~ 192.168.1.3)**, for the listed paths, limit clients to 2 requests per minute (bursts of 2) if the request method is **GET** or **POST** and always ignore `/dist/app.js`:

```
ratelimit get,post 2 2 minute {
    whitelist 1.2.3.4/32,192.168.1.0/30
    status *
    /foo.html
    /api
    ^/dist/app.js
}
```
