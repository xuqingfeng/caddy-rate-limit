### Syntax

**Excessive requests will be terminated with an error 429 (Too Many Requests) !**

For single resource:

```
ratelimit path rate burst unit
```

- path is the file or directory to apply `rate limit`

- rate is the limited request in every time unit (r/s, r/m, r/h) (e.g. 1)

- burst is the maximum burst size client can exceed; burst >= rate (e.g. 2)
 
- unit is the time interval (currently support: `second`, `minute`, `hour`)

For multiple resources:

```
ratelimit rate burst unit {
    resources
}
```

- resources is a list of files/directories to apply `rate limit`, one per line


### Examples

Limit clients to 2 requests per second (bursts of 3) to any resources in /r:

```
ratelimit /r 2 3 second
```

For the listed paths, limit clients to 2 requests per minute (bursts of 2):

```
ratelimit 2 2 minute {
    /foo.html
    /dir
}
```
